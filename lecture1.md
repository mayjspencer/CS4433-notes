# Optimization Notes - Chapter 1

# Optimization Problems
### Find the best solution among all possibilities.
• Maximize Profit, Minimize Cost , Maximize Speed

# Mathematical Modeling
min    f(x)
S.T.  x ∈ X

## Objective/Cost/Energy Function f(x) : The quantity that you want to optimize.

• Decision/Design/Control Variable x : The unknown values that the objective
function depends on.

• Constraints x ∈ X : The limitations on the decision variable.

• Search Space X : Set of all feasible sets (decision values that satisfy the constraints).

## The three key elements of optimization algorithms are:

• Robustness

• Efficiency

• Accuracy

## Deterministic: The steps and obtained values are repeatable.

๏ Such as Linear Programming (simplex method)

## Stochastic: It uses randomness.

๏ Such as Metaheuristics (genetic algorithms).
